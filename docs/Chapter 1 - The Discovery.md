_“No one forgets how it began. No one really knows how it began either. All that the sisters of the Orden Galáctica know is what they read on the first day of their convent”_

Rachel frowned at the screen, and said, “What is that? I don’t think I have seen that before.”

Jacques zoomed in to the surface of the planet and opened up the 3D model on the other monitor. There was a very tiny circle around the equator. 

Rachel: What the heck is it?

Jacques: I don't know.

Rachel: Zoom in some more. Seems like the modeling is finished. 

By then, the 3D modeling has finished working. Jacques switched to the second monitor and rotated the globe to get to the equator. Then, with a twitch of a finger, he zoomed in. 

A silence fell upon the cabin. The only thing that can be heard is the humming of the plasma engine and Roger's rapid breathing. There it was, in the midst of the barren sandy desert. It looked like a building — a shiny dome-shaped building peeking out of nowhere. The monitor showed that it was 14.2 feet above the surrounding surface, and was metallic. 

No one knew how to respond to this. No one knew for certain what this was or what this meant. It was just pure, clean, silence. 

Rachel broke the first word.
Rachel: Where did that come from? I do not remember seeing that before. Check for yesterday’s modeling of the region.
