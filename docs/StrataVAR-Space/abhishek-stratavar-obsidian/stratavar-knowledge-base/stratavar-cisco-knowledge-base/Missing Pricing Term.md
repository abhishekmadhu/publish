We detected that an item from Cisco doesn't contain the pricing term when retrieved via the Cisco Quote API. We reached out to Cisco for details. 

**Good news:** 
We have a pretty good guess on the reason why this item (and many like it) does not have a pricing term.

What is TNC item - Term and Contract Item.
These are the first SAAS Items being sold by Cisco, and at that time those neither had term nor had Pricing term. 
All were 1 year. 
Over the time, the prices on some have been changed, and some haven't. 


CON-
-SNT-
-SNTP-

**Bad news:**
TNC and TNC+ items may not have the Pricing Term. 
There is not right assumption for this case. 
There is also no way to identify TNC and/or TNC+ items, so we cannot prompt/alert the sales engineer in case those are present in the quote. 

Question by Abhishek: If the term is not defined, how does Cisco calculate the extended prices in case a user adds it to a deal?
Answer: No one knows. And no one knows how to find out. Wayne asked a lot of people in the past 3 weeks, and the answer has been "good luck finding out".
