Difference between [[Cisco Deal Registrations|Cisco Deal Registrations]] and [[Cisco Quotes|Cisco Quotes]]

>[!note] Quote from Cisco Commerce Deals Quick Reference Guide for Partners
>Create a deal when you need to apply incentives (programs and promotions) that require additional approval. Create a Quote (see additional references at end of document) to use standard discounts or pre-approved incentives. After approval, both Deals and Quotes can be converted to Orders.

In Cisco terms, deal is the overall agreement between the [[Cisco Partner|Cisco Partner]] and [[Cisco|Cisco]] that enables the Partner to purchase goods or services at a discounted price. 
The quote is the “output” (the compilation of configured products and services with applicable discounts and incentives, which include programs and promotions) that the Cisco Partner can convert to a [[Cisco Order|Cisco Order]] for purchase.

>[!info] Best Practice: 
>Register deals to take advantage of Cisco’s pricing model with stackable, incremental discounts that allow **multiple incentives (programs and promotions) on a single deal**, and reduce your dependency on non-standard transactions.
