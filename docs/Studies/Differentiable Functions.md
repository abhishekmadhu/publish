In calculus, a differentiable function is ==a function in one variable with a derivative at every point in its domain==. The tangent line to the graph of a differentiable function is always non-vertical at each interior point in its domain. 

A differentiable function cannot have: 
- Breaks, 
- Jumps, 
- Cusps, 
- Kinks, 
- Angles
- Vertical portions
