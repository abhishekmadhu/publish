# Getting TensorFlow Developer Certified Curriculum

All of notes and curriculum for passing the TensorFlow Developer Certification exam.  I (@Abhishek Madhu) added a few of mine as well.

Why get TensorFlow developer certified? Fun. Plus it gives me something to work towards and a reason to study.

## Minimum requirements

If you're looking to get TensorFlow Developer Certified, I'd recommend the resources above as the minimum requirements.

You might want to also consider taking the [Zero to Mastery Machine Learning course](https://dbourke.link/mlcourse) .

Once you've got some experience with machine learning, then come back to this page to prepare for the certification.

## Notes

Various notes I took whilst studying (public) and during the exam (private).

- Not sure why but whenever I submit a programming assessment on Coursera, it doesn't pass the grader even though the code works... not to worry. I'm interested in the materials.
