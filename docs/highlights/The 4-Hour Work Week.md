Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: what you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it. I call this the “freedom multiplier.” — location: [480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006X0M2TS&location=480) ^ref-33925

Busy yourself with the routine of the money wheel, pretend it’s the fix-all, and you artfully create a constant distraction that prevents you from seeing just how pointless it is. Deep down, you know it’s all an illusion, but with everyone participating in the same game of make-believe, it’s easy to forget. The problem is more than money. — location: [690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006X0M2TS&location=690) ^ref-36850

Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: “Is this the condition that I feared?” —SENECA — location: [804](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006X0M2TS&location=804) ^ref-12213

‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.’ You won’t believe what you can accomplish by attempting the impossible with the courage to repeatedly fail better.” — location: [1047](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006X0M2TS&location=1047) ^ref-29586
