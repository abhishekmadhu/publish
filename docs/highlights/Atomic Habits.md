## Highlights
Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight. I don’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them. — location: [153](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=153) ^ref-44314

You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. — location: [280](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=280) ^ref-54913

---
Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=289) ^ref-41320

---
But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the [[Plateau of Latent Potential|Plateau of Latent Potential]]. — location: [330](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=330) ^ref-46549

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. — location: [414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=414) ^ref-43037

---
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. — location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=419) ^ref-43703

---
Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning. — location: [483](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=483) ^ref-14615

---
The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=496) ^ref-63002

---
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. — location: [566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=566) ^ref-24554

---
It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. — location: [582](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=582) ^ref-45261

---
We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. — location: [867](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=867) ^ref-33592

The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit. — location: [941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=941) ^ref-13146

Create a plan for DSA for short term and one for long term

The punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.7 — location: [956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=956) ^ref-34322

---
Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course. — location: [976](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=976) ^ref-16512

The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. — location: [1001](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1001) ^ref-54368

---
When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing. — location: [1046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1046) ^ref-60098

People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. — location: [1117](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1117) ^ref-53401

perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. — location: [1278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1278) ^ref-28265

---
One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. — location: [1304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1304) ^ref-28341

---
Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible. — location: [1318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1318) ^ref-65209

---
It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward. — location: [1437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1437) ^ref-26620

---
You can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking strategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your behavior. — location: [1495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1495) ^ref-13740

After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]. — location: [1498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1498) ^ref-52329

Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together. — location: [1588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1588) ^ref-36008

---
Here’s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address the same underlying motive. One person might learn to reduce stress by smoking a cigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety by going for a run. Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. — location: [1718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1718) ^ref-23301
