# 1. [Book] Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow Notes

All book notes from the [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron (2nd edition)](https://amzn.to/3aYexF2) for general machine learning study as well as [preparation for the TensorFlow Developer Certification](https://www.notion.so/Getting-TensorFlow-Developer-Certified-Curriculum-ff8385b6f9284fdfbc930ea06ce8749c).

**Game plan:** Read it cover to cover. No in-depth note-taking, only notes on topics and pages I'd like to revisit for the second pass. Come back and revisit after reading through.

## 1.1. To do

- [ ]  Read the book cover to cover — 799 pages means about 30 pages per day minimum to do it in a month
    - [ ]  Take notes on topics and pages to revisit
- [ ]  Go back through the book, revisiting topics and different pages from above
    - [ ]  Take more in-depth notes and create practical examples

    - "If you plot the loss as a function of the learning rate (using a log scale for the learning rate), you should see it dropping at first. But after a while, the learning rate will be too large, so the loss will shoot back up: the optimal learning rate will be a bit lower than the point at which the loss starts to climb (typically about 10 times lower than the turning point)."model.

**Appendix B: Machine Learning Project Checklist**

- 🔑 755 — The Machine Learning Project Checklist
    1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.
    2. Get the data.
        - Automate as much as possible so you can easily get fresh data.
    3. Explore the data to gain insights.
    4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine Learning algorithms.
        - Work on copies of the data (keep the original intact).
        - Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for reproducibility.
        - Fix or remove outliers (optional).
        - Fill in missing values or drop their rows.
        - Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.
        - Discretize continuous features: put them in buckets.
        - Decompose features (e.g. categorical, date/time, etc).
        - Add promising transformations of features (e.g. log(x), sqrt(x), x^2, etc).
        - Aggregate features into promising new features.
        - Feature scaling: standardise or normalise features.
    5. Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones.
        - Try many quick-and-dirty models from different categories using standard parameters.
        - For each model, use N-fold cross-validation and compute the mean and standard deviation of the performance measure on the N folds.
        - Analyse the types of errors the models make.
            - What data would a human have used to avoid these errors?
        - Perform a quick round of feature selection and engineering.
        - Perform one or two more quick iterations of the five previous steps.
        - Short-list the top three to five most promising models, preferring models that make different types of errors.
    6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.
        - For this step, use as much data as possible.
        - Always automate what you can.
        - Treat your data transformation choices (e.g. replacing missing values with mean, median or drop the rows) as hyperparameters.
        - Prefer random search over grid search and if training is very long, you might want to look into using a Bayesian optimisation approach.
        - Try ensemble methods, combining your best models will often produce better performance than running them individually.
        - Once you’re confident about your final model, measure its performance on the test set to estimate the generalisation error.
    7. Present your solution.
        - What worked, what didn’t?
        - How does your solution stack up against business metrics?
    8. Launch, monitor and maintain your system.
        - Remember, models start to “rot” as data evolves, retrain your models on a regular basis on fresh data (automate as much as possible).
