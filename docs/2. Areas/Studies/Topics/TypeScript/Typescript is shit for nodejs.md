[[typescript|TypeScript]] is a shitty thing to work with in case you are working with [[../../../../general/NodeJS|NodeJS]].
[[Typescript is shit for nodejs|Typescript is shit for nodejs]]
Here are a few reasons why:
1. The compilation is shitty and time taking. 
2. There is no current native way to "bring in non-compiled files" -- supported by Babel. 
3. The whole ecosystem seems to be a "patch on a patch" mountain of patches to get things going. 

It is easier to use the normal function call mechanism and not use [[typescript|TypeScript]] at all.
