Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that measures how likely something is to happen. 

- 0 - no chance
- 1 - certain

> Fun Fact: $np.random.random() \in [0.1)$

[[Sample Space|Sample Space]] - A set (for discrete) or range (for continuous) representing all possible outcomes of an event. 

Probabilities always add up to 1.0 over all possible events in the sample space. 

For an unbiased coin flip, the probability of getting a head is same as that of getting a tail. 
We represent it as 

$$P(X=head) = P(X=tail) = 0.5$$
The $X$ is termed as a "Random Variable"
$P(X)$ is read as "Probability of the event $X$".
