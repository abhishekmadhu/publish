Test case is hotel chef

1. Optimize process
2. Prepare beforehand (preprocessing and scheduled jobs)
3. Remove single points of failure - Backup Chef
4. Single Responsibility Chefs (micro-service architecture)
5. Multiple shops to help avoid electricity and licensing issues (distributed system with local partitions)
6. Routing and load balancing based on well defined parameters
7. Decoupling the systems (chefs should not manage delivery agents)
8. Logging and analytics and auditing
9. Extensible system (today pizza, tomorrow burgers, but the order system does not need to change)
