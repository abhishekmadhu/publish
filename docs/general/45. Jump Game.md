Explanation: https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/solutions/4371968/bad-solution-in-linear-time-but-each-element-can-be-visited-max-1000-times/ 

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        minimums = {}

        # collect the list of jumps required from each item in list
        jumpsStore = [0]*len(nums)

        # until I reach the end of the array (guaranteed to reach)
        for i in range(len(nums)-2, -1, -1):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                jumpsStore[i] = float('inf')
                continue

            jumpZone = 0
            jump_capacity = nums[i]
            if (i + jump_capacity) < len(nums):
                jumpZone = nums[i] 
            else: 
                jumpZone = len(nums)-1
                
            jumpsStore[i] = 1 + (min(jumpsStore[i+1: i+(jumpZone)+1 ]))

        return jumpsStore[0]
