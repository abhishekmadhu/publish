A first principle is a basic assumption that cannot be deduced any further. *(from https://jamesclear.com/first-principles)*

First principles thinking is a fancy way of saying “think like a scientist.” Scientists don’t assume anything. They start with questions like, _What are we absolutely sure is true? What has been proven?_  *(from https://jamesclear.com/first-principles)*
