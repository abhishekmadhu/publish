> **Base64** is a group of [binary-to-text encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding "Binary-to-text encoding") schemes that represent [binary data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_data "Binary data") (more specifically, a sequence of 8-bit [bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte "Byte")) in sequences of 24 [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit") that can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits.

> Common to all binary-to-text encoding schemes, Base64 is designed to carry data stored in binary formats across channels that only reliably support text content. Base64 is particularly prevalent on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web")[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#cite_note-1) where one of its uses is the ability to embed [image files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_files "Image files") or other binary assets inside textual assets such as [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS "CSS") files.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#cite_note-2)
 
> Base64 is also widely used for sending [e-mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail "E-mail") attachments. This is required because [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol") – in its original form – was designed to transport [7-bit ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-bit_ASCII "7-bit ASCII") characters only. This encoding causes an overhead of 33–37% (33% by the encoding itself; up to 4% more by the inserted line breaks).
