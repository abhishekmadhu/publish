Definition: **The ease with which our brain processes information**; this quality impacts how positively (or negatively) we feel about something.

<hr>

Human beings have evolved to take comfort in familiar environments. Familiar environments are easy to process. Common trees and animals, neighborhood, etc are easy to process. So people favor it. 

But a stray tiger in the environment is unfamiliar, and therefore hard to process. The brain feels uncomfortable and springs to action.

#### Situations and Sources
Familiar situations are favored. If you see something that is false but was seen many times, it seems to be true. 

Other sources of cognitive ease are:
- What is familiar
- What is easy
- What validates preexisting beliefs
