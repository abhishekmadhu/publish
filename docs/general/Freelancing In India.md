## Resident Freelancers in India

In India, you are a freelancer, if you work for organizations or companies, on short contracts. However, if you work for private individuals such as homeowners, you are self-employed.

Overall, freelancers have no commitment to work solely for one company or organization. If they do, they are employees on contract.  

## Non-resident Freelancers in India

You need to have a work visa in order for you to work in India, and you must obtain it before you come to India. The exception is if you or your spouses are of Indian descent.

Freelancers of Indian descent, you can get an entry visa that lasts for six months. That visa will also allow you to work as a freelancer in India. Everyone else needs an employment visa, to work in India.

To get an employment visa, you need at least a signed work contract with an Indian company. The contract should have a fixed-rate pay or salary for a specified period.

If you are Bhutan and Nepalese freelancer, the visa requirements do not apply to you. You do not need to apply for a work visa, to freelance in India.  

## Establishing a Freelance Career in India

Once you get an employment visa, you can come to India and set up a firm offering your freelance service. Your firm needs to have a Memorandum of Articles of Association.

The Memorandum of Articles of Association must be approved by the Superintendent of Stamps. You can then forward your firm’s name to the Registrar of Companies for approval.

Once the Registrar of Companies approves your firm, you can focus on growing your freelance business. Overall, it can be easier to get an attorney or immigration agent to help you get a work visa, and set up your freelance business.  

## Taxes for Freelancers in India

The Indian government expects you to pay your taxes as a freelancer, and file your taxes at the Income Tax [Department’s online portal](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Pages/downloads/income-tax-return.aspx). In case your clients deduct the tax at the source, then you can claim a tax deduction when filing your taxes.

### Calculating Your Freelance Income

To pay your taxes on your freelance income in India, all you need to do is calculate your gross income. You then deduct any deductible business expenses. You can then calculate the tax due using the applicable income tax rates. Loans do not qualify as a source of income, so exclude them.

You must calculate your taxable income from 1 April of the previous calendar year, to the end of 31 March of the current calendar year. That means you can start filing your taxes from the 1st of April of the current year.

You must also include other sources of income, apart from those of your freelance income, in your Income Tax Return (ITR) 4 form. These may include income you may have gotten from other investments or income-generating activities.

## Presumptive Taxation

If your freelance income is less than Rs 50 Lakhs in a year, you can now pay Presumptive Tax. You can file it under the “Business and Profession” head.

You calculate the Presumptive Tax at a rate of 8%, of presumptive income. In that case, an income of Rs 50 Lakhs, you will pay a Presumptive Tax of 4 Lakhs.

Moreover, under section 44AD of the Income Tax Act, the presumptive assumption rate is 50% for freelancers and other professionals. That means if you had Rs 1000 turnover, your assumed profit is Rs 500.

As a freelancer, to file presumptive tax under section 44AD and 44AE of the Income Tax Act, you use the ITR Form 4S.

## Advance Tax for Freelancers

If your freelance tax liability exceeds Rs 10,000, you need to pay the Advance Tax. For instance, you may need to pay your taxes quarterly, instead of annually.

Under section 234 B and 234 C of the Income Tax Act, you can be charged some interest on your final tax, for failure to remit it after it exceeded the Rs 10,000 limit.

## Freelance Contracts with Clients in India

As a freelancer working in India, having a contract is not only legal, but we recommend it. A business contract between you and your clients protects both of you legally and helps to prevent misunderstandings.

While there are many aspects of your work that you can specify in your contract, we are going to look at the basics.

### Sign the Contract

Before you start work, especially if you are not working on a freelance platform, you need to have a signed contract. You can opt to meet clients physically and sign your contract, or use of digital contracts, which you can both sign online.

### Identities of Parties Involved

You need to have a contract that clearly states whom you are doing business with, and where they are located. That can include their legally registered business/company name, company email/physical address, phone contacts, tax number, among other legal business details.

### Scope of Work

Your contract should state the scope of work you are going to undertake when you expect to get paid. It should also state what the client’s input will be, and when they should give it. The contract should also offer cancellation options for you and the client.

### Deadlines and Payment Schedules

There should be a clear deadline when you must deliver the work, and whether you are going to bill the client hourly, weekly, monthly, or per project. Furthermore, the contract should give a clear schedule of how payments are going to be made.

This can be in a lump sum, periodically, or after a milestone has been achieved. In case there are revisions, or additional work, the contract should be clear on how they are going to get billed. You must also specify how you will pay taxes to India’s Income Tax Department.

### Confidentiality

Your contract should state how confidential the project is, what can be shared with third parties and cannot be shared with entities who are not a party to the contract.

### Credits for Your Work

Depending on your profession, getting credit for your work may be important for you, even when you get paid for it. In that regard, you should discuss it with your client, and include a clause about it in the contract.

### Contract Limitations

Your contract should state how free you are to engage or work with other parties, who may be considered to be competitors of your client. That may limit you from getting additional work, while the project is ongoing or while the client is in the business.

### Legally Binding

A contract is a legally binding document, and you must consider all aspects of your work and career plans before you sign it. While there are many freelance contract templates online, not all are tailored for the Indian freelance market or business laws.

In that regard, getting your lawyer in India to create a favorable template for you is recommended. Overall, once you sign a contract with your client, they can use it against you in a court of law, just as you would.

Therefore, you must be ready to commit to every word in it, once you sign it.
