**[[Margin in Quoting|Margin]]** and **[[Markup in Quoting|Markup]]** are two different ways of looking at the profit on a sale. They both focus on the same amount of money – the difference between your buying and selling prices. However, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">they express that amount as a percentage in different ways</mark>.

**Margin Percentage**: Margin refers to the revenue a company makes after paying the cost of goods sold (COGS). The margin percentage is calculated by taking revenue minus the cost of goods sold, and the difference is shown as a percentage of revenue.

For example, if a product sells for `$100` and it costs `$70` to manufacture, its margin is `$30`. The profit margin, stated as a percentage, is `30%`.

**Markup Percentage**: Markup shows how much more a company’s selling price is than the amount the item costs the company. Markup is the retail price for a product minus its cost, but the markup percentage is calculated differently. The formula for markup percentage is:
$\left( \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Cost}} \right) \times 100$

Using the same numbers as above, the markup percentage would be `42.9%`.

>[!note] How to remember? 
>Markup is by what ratio the `profit` is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">up</mark> from `cost`. So, `cost` is the denominator. $\frac{\text{profit}}{\text{cost}}$

Note that $\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}$ can also be written as $\text{profit}$ or $\text{margin}$.

In summary, while both margin and markup deal with the difference between the selling price and the cost of a product, they express this difference as a percentage of different bases: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">margin uses the selling price as the base, while markup uses the cost as the base</mark>.
