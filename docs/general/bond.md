A bond is a debt investment instrument that generally provides dived returns for/after a fixed period of time. 

## Yield of a bond
-   **Coupon yield**, also known as the coupon rate, is the annual interest rate established when the bond is issued that does not change during the lifespan of the bond.
-   **Current yield** is the bond's coupon yield divided by its current market price. If the current market price changes, the current yield will also change.

For example, if you buy a $1,000 bond at par (often described as “trading at 100,” meaning 100 percent of its face value) and receive $45 in annual interest payments, your coupon yield is 4.5 percent. If the price goes up and the bond subsequently trades at 103 ($1,030), then the coupon yield will fall to 4.37 percent.

Current yield matters if you plan to sell your bond before maturity. But if you buy a new bond at par and hold it to maturity, your current yield when the bond matures will be the same as the coupon yield.
